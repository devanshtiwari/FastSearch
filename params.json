This will take some time depending upon the number of files. After successfuly execution of init function, one can search for files.\r\n\r\n* **Fsearch(String,boolean)** or **Fsearch(String)**\r\n  \r\nParameter String takes the Full File or folder name to search. The boolean values indicates whether the file is directory or not. If is it directory one is searching for it will be true. If no boolean parameter is passed then it is by default considered false.\r\n  \r\nAfter the usage of init function, there's no need to index it once again. Searching files again and again in the same directory will be fast and easy just by using Fsearch. \r\n\r\n**Example Code App.java**\r\n  \r\nApp.java is example code which can show the functional utility.
